Foot step prediction Models

Data was collected using a depth camera. 
The following github code was used to extract the 3D co-ordinates of the entire body and from this only the foot joints and knee joints data was aggregated and used to build our predictive models.

MLP, LSTM and CNN models were built using the data collected.
